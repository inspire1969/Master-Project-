# Master-Project-
The aim of project is to design a anti-theft device via integrating the 10bit
accelerometer with the modern 32bit Cortex-M3 processor. The theme of the
projectc was to measure acceleration of the bike during lock position, and as it
detect the acceleration beyond threshold. It will send notification to the
registerd mobile through GSM and Bluetooth. Furthermore, the integrated
alarm will also be triggred to prevent from stoling. The device include
rechargeable battery that will stay charged for minimum duration of one week
and it will charged by bicycle danamo.
The project work consist of low power design and component selction. The
prototype was design and tested successfully. Final PCB was also designed for
product.
